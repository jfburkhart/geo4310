    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have mostly dealt with histrograms of observations and used them as **empirical probability distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you may have a variable in your model for which **you don't have actual data** and cannot derive from first principles (e.g. physical processes). It may be that our variable would be too complex to model, or we simply don't have a model for it. Hopefully, however, you have some information on this variable, and perhaps that comes in the form of a **distribution**. The distribution then, is simply the description of the probability of observation for that variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parametric distributions** are idealizations of real data and so are theoretical constructs or abstractions:\n",
    "* they only have few parameters instead of n observations (compactness)\n",
    "* they will represent real data only approximately\n",
    "* they can be used for interpolation (gap filling) and extrapolations (describing extreme values or \"as-yet-unobserved behavior\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some distributions that are well known and used often to help us describe a random variable of interest. The usefulness of the distribution stems from the following reasons: (1) The function is the result of an underlying physical process and is **derived on the basis of certain physically reasonable assumptions**; (2) the function is the result of some limiting process; and (3) it is widely known and the necessary statistical information is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, let us talk about **discrete distributions** that describe random variables (the data of interest) that can take on only particular values."
