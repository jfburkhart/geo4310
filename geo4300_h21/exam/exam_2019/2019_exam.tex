\section{Random variables}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
\item Explain or define the mean, median and mode of a random variable. \textbf{\hfill (3 points)}
\item Explain or define a measure of dispersion of a random variable. \textbf{\hfill (2 points)}
\item For bivariate random variables, explain how the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman rank correlation coefficients are calculated and explain the differences between them. You may draw a simple sketch to illustrate the differences. \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\end{enumerate}




\section{Hypothesis testing}
Based on two samples with respectively 1000 and 100 observations, the following estimates for mean and standard deviations have been obtained:

Sample 1 ($n_1=1000$): \hspace{0.3in} $\bar{x}_1=44.1$ \hspace{0.3in} $\sigma_1=11.3$

Sample 2 ($n_2=100$): \hspace{0.3in} $\bar{x}_2=48.0$ \hspace{0.3in} $\sigma_2=8.2$


\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
    \item Test if the estimates for mean and standard deviation are significantly different. Use a significance level of 5\%. \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
	\item We make two types of errors in hypothesis testing. Explain these type I and type II errors, and illustrate graphically the relation between them. \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Goodness-of-fit testing}
The table below shows July precipitation data ($P$ in inches) for $N=30$ years of observations between 1951 and 1980 in Ithaca, New York.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{table48} 
%    \caption{}
\end{figure}

The mean value of the data is $\bar{P}=3.54$ inches and the standard deviation $s=1.77$ inches.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
\item Bin the data in suitable classes and sketch the cumulative histogram of the dataset. \\ \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\item Use the Chi-square method to test the hypothesis that the data fit the normal distribution. Use a significance level of 5\%. \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Time series analysis}
Consider the following time series $X_t$ sampled at $n=70$ time steps:

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{autocorrelation_y} 
%    \caption{}
\end{figure}


\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item The following three graphs show autocorrelation functions for lags $L \le 50$, defined as:
$$ r_L = \frac{1}{n-L} \sum_{t=1}^{n-L} (X_t-\bar{X}) (X_{t+L} - \bar{X}) / \frac{1}{n} \sum_{t=1}^n (X_t-\bar{X})^2$$

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{autocorrelation_rl} 
%    \caption{}
\end{figure}
Which one of them (A, B or C) shows the autocorrelation of $X_t$? Explain your answer. \\ \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}

\item How could you test for a trend in $X_t$? Explain a suitable test. \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Machine learning}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)] 
\item What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised machine learning? Give an example of one model/learning algorithm and argue why you can categorize it as supervised (or unsupervised). \textbf{\hfill (5 points)}
\item Explain the difference between the two main types of supervised machine learning: regression and classification. Give an example of each type. \textbf{\hfill (5~points)}
\end{enumerate}
