    "### Cumulative Distribution Function -- discrete case\n",
    "\n",
    "Denoted $F(x) = P(X \\le x)$, we can use the *cumulative distribution\n",
    "function*, $c.d.f$ to evaluate the probability properties of a random\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, we plotted the $c.d.f$ along with the $p.m.f$.\n",
    "Note, that all is required for the $c.d.f.$ is to calculate the\n",
    "cumulative sum (e.g. cumsum) of the $p.m.f.$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge of either the $c.d.f.$ or the $p.m.f.$ of a random variable\n",
    "allows the other to be calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F(x) = \\sum_{y=y\\le x}{P(X = y)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $P(X=y)= p_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $c.d.f.$ is an increasing step function, with steps at each value of\n",
    "the random variable. The heights of each step are simply the\n",
    "probabilities associated with each value. We can obtain the $p.m.f.$\n",
    "from the $c.d.f.$ through the relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X = x) = F(X) - F(X^-)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $F(X^-)$ is the limiting value (e.g. 2 in the dice example). So at\n",
    "that point, $F(X) = F(X^-)$ and the $c.d.f.$ is $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Density Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The analogue to $p.m.f.$ for a *continuous* random variable is the\n",
    "$p.d.f.$, or **probability density function**. Continuous random\n",
    "variables are members of the set of real numbers ${\\rm I\\!R}$ and $x$\n",
    "may take any value within a continuous region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of continuous random variables are instantaneous\n",
    "streamflow, soil moisture values, temperature and humidity. We can still\n",
    "define limits to the random variable, so that they may be within\n",
    "$0 \\le x \\le \\infty$ for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many continuous random variables are measured at discrete\n",
    "intervals. So, for instance, you might have daily precipitation\n",
    "measurements. But the *value* of the precipitation is what falls on the\n",
    "continuous interval. But this can be further confused by the fact that\n",
    "some measurement devices can only provide a value to a certain\n",
    "sensitivity. Often times continuous random variables are measured in\n",
    "discrete terms (e.g. think about a compass heading). What truly\n",
    "distinguishes a discrete from continuous random variable is how we\n",
    "define the probablistic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "For continuous random variables, a $p.d.f.$ is used. This function\n",
    "$f(x)$ is must evaluate to a positive value and integrate to 1 over the\n",
    "whole sample space. So we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) \\ge 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{\\S} {f(x)dx} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the probability that the value of interest lies within the\n",
    "region of interest, we integrate teh $p.d.f.$ between the two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(a \\le X \\le b) = \\int_{a}^b{f(x)dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** Perhaps the most important way to distinguish between discrete\n",
    "and continuous random variables is that fact that a **continuous random\n",
    "variable cannot take a specific value of x**. Put another way, the\n",
    "probability that $X$ takes the value $a$ is always $0$!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look closer:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(X=a) = \\int_{a}^a{f(x)dx} = F(a) - F(a) = 0$$\n",

    "Main Descriptors of Random Variables\n",
    "------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The $p.m.f.$ and $c.d.f.$ provide useful tools for describing the\n",
    "probability properties of a random variable, however, there are some\n",
    "general characteristics that are also of interest. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   the *central* or *Expected Value*\n",
    "-   the *Variance*\n",
    "\n",
    "While these characteristics are useful in describing a random variable,\n",
    "it is important to keep in mind that two random variables may have the\n",
    "same mean, median, or otherwise, but their probability distributions may\n",
    "be quite different.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Value of a Random Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value or expectation of a *discrete* random variable with a\n",
    "**probability mass function**, \\$ P(X = x\\_i ) = p\\_i\\$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(X) = \\sum_x {p_i  x_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(X)$ provides a summary measure of the average value taken by the\n",
    "random variable and is also known as the **mean** of the random\n",
    "variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to think of the *expected value* as a *weighted average*\n",
    "withing the sample space, $S$, where the weights are the probabilities\n",
    "$x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous Case\n",
    "\n",
    "For the *continuous* case, the expected value is simply the integral of\n",
    "the $p.d.f.$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(X) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty {x \\cdot f(x)dx}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes for when we cover the *Method of Moments* - The expected\n",
    "value of $(x- \\mu)^i$ is equal to the $i^{th}$ central moment\n",
    "$E[(x- \\mu)^i ] = μ_i$ ; later on we will show that when $i = 2$, $μ_i$\n",

    "the *central tendency* by using the product of values (as opposed to the\n",
    "arithmetic mean which uses their sum). The geometric mean is defined as\n",
    "the $n^{th}$ root of the product of $n$ numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar X_G = \\left(\\prod_{i=1}^n x_i \\right)^{1/n} = \\sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n};$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, $\\prod x_i = x_1 x_2 x_3 ... x_n$;\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the geometric mean of two numbers, say 2 and 8, is just\n",
    "the square root of their product; that is $\\sqrt{2\\cdot 8}=4$. As\n",
    "another example, the geometric mean of the three numbers 4, 1, and 1/32\n",
    "is the cube root of their product (1/8), which is 1/2; that is\n",
    "$\\sqrt[3]{4\\cdot 1\\cdot 1/32}=1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good when comparing, or using together random values of different\n",
    "magnitude, as it naturally *normalizes* the values so that they may be\n",
    "compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "is the quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{ \\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + \\cdots + w_n x_n}{w_1 + w_2 + \\cdots + w_n}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore data elements with a high weight contribute more to the\n",
    "weighted mean than do elements with a low weight. The weights cannot be\n",
    "negative. Some may be zero, but not all of them (since division by zero\n",
    "is not allowed).\n",
    "\n",
    "The common mean $\\frac {1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n {x_i}$ is a special case of\n",
    "the weighted mean where all data have equal weights, $w_i=w$. When the\n",
    "weights are normalized then $w_i'=\\frac{1}{n}.$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Median\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is that value of $x$ for which $P(X≤x) = P(X≥x) = 0.5$. In\n",
    "the case of a **continuous** distribution the median corresponds to an\n",
    "ordinate which separates density curve into two parts having equal areas\n",
    "of 1⁄2 each.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\mu_{md}} {f(x)dx} = \\int_{\\mu_{md}}^{\\infty} {f(x)dx} = 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, there are equal chances of selecting data above and below the\n",
    "median.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **discrete** random variable, the median is the value halfway\n",
    "through the *ordered data set*, below and above which there is an equal\n",
    "number of data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mu_{md} = x_p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where; $p$ is determined from $\\sum_{i=1}^p f(x_i) = 0.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode is simply a measure of where the most values are located in the\n",
    "distribution. However, it is not necessarily equal to the mean or\n",
    "median. The shape of the distribution has a greater impact on the median\n",
    "and mean, and their lack of equivalence to the mode can indicate extreme\n",
    "values.\n",
    "\n",
    "for the **continuous** case, the mode is equal to the location where the\n",
    "$p.d.f.$ reaches a maximum value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$${df(x) \\over dx } = 0;\\  and \\  {d^2f(x) \\over dx^2} \\lt 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For **discrete** variable mode is the x value associated with\n",
    "$Max_{i=1}^n f( x_i )$\n",
    "\n",
    "*A sample or population may have none, one or more than one mode. (Can\n",
    "you give an example of each case?)*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Dispersion\n",
    "\n",
    "The term dispersion refers to the spread of the data. We are interested\n",
    "in understanding something about the *variability* of the data. If we\n",
    "are told a distribution has an expected value, $E(X)$, of 0.5 --does\n",
    "that give us any information about the *shape* of the distribution? To\n",
    "have an idea of the probability properties of a distribution, we need to\n",
    "understand more information than just the *central tendencies*. Some\n",
    "common measures of dispersion include: **Range**, **Variance**, and the\n",
    "**Coefficient of Variation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Range\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest measure, it is the difference between the maximum and\n",
    "minumum values\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Range = X_{max}  - X_{min}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance provides a more robust measure of the variability of a\n",
    "population. The variance is a non-negative number given us insight into\n",
    "how widely distributed the values of the random variable are likely to\n",
    "be. If we have very high variance, it decreases the 'chance' that we\n",
    "will draw the central value. In other words, the $x_i$ are more\n",
    "scattered within the the distribution. Think of *Variance* \\~\n",
    "*variability*. We symbolize variance with $Var(X) \\ or \\ V(X)$ or\n",
    "$\\sigma^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(X) = \\sigma^2 = E[X-E(X)]^2 = E(x-\\mu)^2 = \\int (x-\\mu)^2 f(x)dx$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the variance is also the **second central moment** or , $u_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **discrete** variable, we can calculate variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_x^2 = {\\sum{(X_i - \\mu)^2 } \\over n }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make a sample estimation of *population* variance from\n",
    "observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S^2 = {\\sum_{i=1}^n{(X_i - \\bar x)^2 } \\over n-1 }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing these equations, not two distinct differences: (1) $\\mu$\n",
    "(*population mean*, which we cannot know) is replaced by $\\bar x$\n",
    "(*sample* mean, an estimate of $\\mu$), and (2) $n$ is replaced by $n-1$\n",
    "in order to have an unbiased estimation of population variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take it as an exercise to prove this by deriving:\n",
    "$E(S^2) = ... \\sigma^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Often it is convenient to work with the **standard deviation** rather\n",
    "than the variance because it has the *same units* as the original\n",
    "variable. We can find the standard deviation simply from the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{V(X)} = \\sqrt { \\sigma^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or from a *Sample Estimation*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\sqrt {{\\sum_{i=1}^n {x_i - \\bar x)^2 }} \\over n-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coefficient of Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient of variation measures the spread of a set of data as a\n",
    "proportion of its mean. It is often expressed as a percentage. It is\n",
    "dimensionless, so it can be used for cross comparison, i.e. for\n",
    "comparison of the variability of the same variable at different places,\n",
    "etc. It is the ratio of the sample standard deviation to the sample\n",
    "mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cv = {S \\over \\bar x }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an equivalent definition for the coefficient of variation of a\n",
    "population, which is based on the expected value and the standard\n",
    "deviation of a random variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cv = { \\sqrt(V(X)) \\over E(X)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measures of Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "Two further *moments* of the distribution exist, these are **skewness**\n",
    "and **kurtosis**. They provide further information regarding the shape\n",
    "of the distribution. Recall, all four of these moments or measures are\n",
    "simply parameters that describe the shape of the distribution function.\n",
    "We are concerned with what we may expect when we 'pull' a sample from a\n",
    "population, given a distribution function, we have a better idea of what\n",
    "to expect... beyond simply an expected value. So, as we think about the\n",
    "shape (so far, central tendency and width), now we look at two measures\n",
    "that give information on the left/right-ness of the distribution and the\n",
    "peakedness.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is a parameter that describes asymmetry in a random variable’s\n",
    "probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$skewness = \\int(x-\\mu)^3f(x)dx = \\mu_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "; it is also the **3rd moment** of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coefficient of skewness** (dimensionless, more commonly used). Several\n",
    "types of skewness are defined, the terminology and notation of which are\n",
    "unfortunately rather confusing. \"The\" coefficient of skew of a\n",
    "distribution is defined to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "**population skewness** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\gamma = {\\mu_3 \\over (\\mu_2)^{3/2 }} = {\\mu_3 \\over \\sigma_3}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\mu_3$ is the 3rd moment about mean, and $\\sigma$ is the standard\n",
    "deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample unbiased estimate** is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Cs = { n \\sum (x_i - \\bar x)^3 \\over (n-1)(n-2)S^3 }$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE*: if $Cs \\gt 0$, Positive skew (long tail in the right, most\n",
    "hydrological variables, e.g. discharge hydrograph, rainfall, etc). If\n",
    "$Cs \\lt 0$, negative skew (tail left).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Kurtosis\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurtosis is a parameter that describes how peaked is a random variable’s\n",
    "probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$kurtosis = \\int(x-\\mu)^4f(x)dx = \\mu_4$$\n",
    "\n",
    "; it is also the **4th moment** of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **sample** of $n$ values the *sample excess kurtosis* is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_2 = \\frac{\\mu_4}{\\mu_{2}^2} -3 = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^4}{\\left(\\tfrac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2\\right)^2} - 3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mu_4$ is the fourth sample moment about the mean, $\\mu_2$ is the\n",
    "second sample moment about the mean (that is, the **variance**), $x_i$\n",
    "is the $i^{th}$ value, and $\\overline{x}$ is the **sample mean**."
